Hello!
I'm Himanshi Gautam from Delhi. I'm a writer, artist, desginer, a budding programmer and a potterhead. Apart from these activities, I really like reading and playing chess.

I want to contribute to open source to gain a real world experience of development. As open source involves a number of people working on the same peoject, it will enable me to work with much more experienced people and this, sharpen my skills. Also, it will allow me to have an even better understanding of the software.
